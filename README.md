# Bank_Inventory_Optimization
A simulation–optimization framework for banknote inventory management using stochastic programming and receding horizon control. The project models multi-echelon cash logistics networks, integrates (s, S) policies, replenishment, callbacks, and rebalancing decisions, and evaluates operational cost and GHG emissions under demand uncertainty.
